    pf_replicate!(state::ParticleFilterState, n_replicates::Int;
                  layout=:contiguous)

Expands a particle filter by replicating each particle `n_replicates` times. 

If `layout` is `:contiguous`, each particle's replicates will be arranged in a
continguous block (e.g., replicates of the first particle will have indices
`1:n_replicates`).

Otherwise, if `layout` is `:interleaved`, each particle's replicates will be
interleaved with the replicates of the other particles (e.g., replicates of the
first particle will have indices `1:n_replicates:N*n_replicates`, where `N` is
the original number of particles).

"""
    pf_dereplicate!(state::ParticleFilterState, n_replicates::Int;
                    layout=:contiguous, method=:keepfirst)

Shrinks a particle filter by retaining one out of every `n_replicates`
particles. The total number of particles must be a multiple of `n_replicates`.

If `layout` is `:contiguous`, each set of replicates is assumed to be arranged
in a contiguous block (e.g., the first particle will be selected out of the
indices `1:n_replicates`).

Otherwise, if `layout` is `:interleaved`, each set of replicates is assumed to
be interleaved with others (e.g., the first particle will be selected out of
the indices `1:n_replicates:N`, where `N` is the total number of particles).

Retained particles can be selected by different methods. If `method` is
`:keepfirst`, only the first particle of each set of replicates is retained,
exactly reversing the effect of [`pf_replicate!`](@ref). If `method` is 
`:sample`, the retained particle is sampled according to its normalized weight
among the replicates.
