    pf_resample!(state::ParticleFilterState, method=:multinomial; kwargs...)

Resamples particles in the filter, stochastically pruning low-weight particles.
The resampling method can optionally be specified: `:multinomial` (default),
`:residual`, or `:stratified`. See [1] for a survey of resampling methods
and their variance properties. A `priority_fn` can also be specified as
keyword argument, which maps log particle weights to custom log priority scores
for the purpose of resampling (e.g. `w -> w/2` for less aggressive pruning).

"""
    pf_multnomial_resample!(state::ParticleFilterState; kwargs...)

Performs multinomial resampling (i.e. simple random resampling) of the
particles in the filter. Each trace (i.e. particle) is resampled with
probability proportional to its weight.

A `priority_fn` can be specified as keyword argument, which maps log particle
weights to custom log priority scores for the purpose of resampling
(e.g. `w -> w/2` for less aggressive pruning).

"""
    pf_residual_resample!(state::ParticleFilterState; kwargs...)

Performs residual resampling of the particles in the filter, which reduces
variance relative to multinomial sampling. For each particle with
normalized weight ``w_i``, ``⌊n w_i⌋`` copies are resampled, where ``n`` is the
total number of particles. The remainder are sampled with probability
proportional to ``n w_i - ⌊n w_i⌋`` for each particle ``i``.

A `priority_fn` can be specified as keyword argument, which maps log particle
weights to custom log priority scores for the purpose of resampling
(e.g. `w -> w/2` for less aggressive pruning).

"""
    pf_stratified_resample!(state::ParticleFilterState; kwargs...)

Performs stratified resampling of the particles in the filter, which reduces
variance relative to multinomial sampling. First, uniform random samples
``u_1, ..., u_n`` are drawn within the strata ``[0, 1/n)``, ..., ``[n-1/n, 1)``,
where ``n`` is the number of particles. Then, given the cumulative normalized
weights ``W_k = Σ_{j=1}^{k} w_j ``, sample the ``k``th particle for each ``u_i``
where ``W_{k-1} ≤ u_i < W_k``.

A `priority_fn` can be specified as keyword argument, which maps log particle
weights to custom log priority scores for the purpose of resampling
(e.g. `w -> w/2` for less aggressive pruning). The `sort_particles` keyword
argument controls whether particles are sorted by weight before stratification
(default: true).
